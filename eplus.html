        <p>With a rich 20 year history, ePlus was one of the first Japanese ticketing sales companies to take advantage of the World Wide Web for ticketing sales and distribution. Their rich history however also belied an incredibly bloated design ecosystem -relics from years of design and development artifacts liter the experience.</p> <br>
        <p>As a result of servicing a wide range of venues, artists, performers, athletic events as well as complying with Japanese government regulations concerning electronic sales of tickets, warnings, and disclaimers, ePlus is built on a mammoth case of business logic. As pain points naturally grew, users were being slowed down and hindered from purchasing tickets.</p> <br>
        <p>ePlus needed to increase their conversion rate but also needed to maintain their SEO copy and database structure. 
        </p> <br>
        <p>For this task, ePlus partnered with Est-Rouge and Senkō Labs for a complete redesign of the UI/UX for the ePlus mobile app, along with building a software development kit to be integrated into Spotify.jp and future investment opportunities.</p> <br>

            *Because much of my work on ePlus is under NDA, the works below are only the parts that are publicly available. Please reach out for more information.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <p><bold>Tasks:</bold> UX/UI DESIGN • USER TESTING • PROTOTYPING • INTERACTION DESIGN • DESIGN SYSTEM • VQA </p>
        <br>
        <p>I iterated rapidly through frequent VQA with engineers and usability tests and collaborated effectively with engineers, PM and business clients through active cross-culture communication and efficient R&D activities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For this project, I collaborated with engineers from the Vietnamese branch of the tech development company Est-Rouge, Japanese product managers from ePlus and 2 US-based designers from Senkō Labs. My areas of focus were on Information Architecture, Filtering Systems, Input and Selection, User Registration and Design Systems. The goal for the design system was to create a cohesive design language and system that not only revitalizes ePlus’s UI but would also translate easily into a software development kit.</p>

        <p>
            ePlus's current mobile app is a Hybrid App that recreates the web experience on mobile. The mobile app reflects the cluttered and confusing layout of the web. For our redesign we'll be working from the ground up, completely redesigning each and every component, style, and interaction to build a native app that seamlessly brings together the search and exploration process.

            <br>
            <p> Each step of the way we built case studies for 15 different possible users and the requirements of their unique flows. Different types of events have different information hierarchies and we needed to create an SDK that can encompass all of the different cases. </p>
                
            <p>In this specific case study, we'll be exploring the journey of one of the users, Fumiko, a rock festival enthusiast, and Fuji Rock attendee. Fuji Rock is an example of an event spanning multiple days, with multiple day tickets, one location, and one time. Different events have different permutations of:</p>

                    <p>With several rounds of different user testings for the selection and payment process, we were able to see which functions people understood well and the parts that they were hesitant about. We picked up some really valuable information and feedback from the users that we tested. After, we chose parts that worked the best with our users and polished them down into one design for more user testings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Below is the synthesis of the data we accumulated and the conclusion we reached:

            <p>Comparing the architecture from before and after, we changed a lot of steps and structures for the selection to completion process to be better, faster and more efficient. The steps that customers needed to take reduced by half amount thanks to combining previously separate parts of the process and minimizing where and how information appears on screen. The users are well guided throughout the whole process from start to finish without any distractions or feeling overwhelmed by the mountain of information they previously felt.</p>
